Decoder/Temperature Inconsistency Analysis. Recreation of paper Figure 6, but vayring the settings of the model's decoder (here the temperature setting) instead of the level of difficulty of the problem. See the included .png image: GSM8K Dataset Reliablity Sets vs Temperature 0.0 to 2.0.png

Additionally Figure 1. is recreated using a problem from the MATH dataset.
